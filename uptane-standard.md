This document describes a framework for securing automotive software update systems.

--- middle


# **1. Introduction**
Uptane is a secure software update framework
for automobiles. This document describes procedures to enable
programmers for OEMs and suppliers to design and implement this
framework to better protect connected units on cars. Integrating
Uptane as outlined in the sections that follow can reduce
the ability of attackers to conpromise critical systems. It also
assures a faster and easier recovery process should a 
compromise occur.

These instructions specify the components necessary for a 
compliant implementation. Individual 
implementors can make their own technological choices within those
requirements. This flexibility makes Uptane adaptable to the
many customized update solutions used by manufacturers.

# **2. Terminology**

## **2.1 Conformance Terminology**

The keywords "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD," "
SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
In order to be considered “Uptane-compliant,” an 
implementation MUST follow all of these rules as specified in the document.

## **2.2 Automotive Terminology**

*Bus*: An internal communications network that interconnects components within
a vehicle. A car can have a number of buses that will vary in terms of power,
speed and resources.

*Image*: File containing all the relevant data and metadata for an ECU. Each 
ECU typically holds only one image, although this may vary in case to case.

*Metadata*: Data about a file that can be used to verify its authenticity
and currency, and to assure that it has not been tampered with or altered
being uploaded to the repository. Metadata information is generally 
cryptographic hashes and file lengths.

*Primary/Secondary ECUs*: Terms used to describe the control units within
an automobile. A primary control unit has more resources than a secondary,
in terms of memory, storage space, connection to the internet, and 
access to a time source. Primary units are updated
directly, while secondary units are generally updated by a primary.

*Repository*: Designated server containing images and metadata.

*Suppliers*: Indepedent companies to which auto manufacturers may 
outsource the production of ECUs. Tier-1 suppliers directly serve the
manufacturers. Tier-2 suppliers are those that receive outsourced work
from Tier-1 suppliers.

*Telematics Systems*: Electronic system that can remotely monitor a vehicle
or its individual components.

*Vehicle Version Manifest*: A compilation of all ECU version manifests on
a vehicle. It serves as a master list of all images currently
running on alll ECUs in the vehcile.


## **2.3. Uptane Role Terminology**

These terms are defined in greater detail in Section 5.

*Delegations*: Designating the responsibility of signing metadata about images to another party. 

*Roles*: The roles mechanism of Uptane allows
the system to distribute signing responsibilities so that the compromise
of one key does not necessarily impact the security of the entire system.

  * *Root Role*: Distributes and revokes public keys used to 
  verify the root, timestamp, snapshot, and targets role metadata.

  * *Snapshot Role*: Indicates which images the repository has released at the
  same time.
  
  * *Targets Role*: Holds the metadata used to verify the image, such as cryptographic hashes and file size.
  
  * *Timestamp Role*: Indicates if there are any new metadata or image 
  on the repository.


## **2.4 Acronyms and Abbreviations**
*CAN Bus*: Controller Area Network bus standard.

*ECUs*: Electronic Control Units, the computing units on vehicle.

*LIN Bus*: Local Interconnect Bus.

*SOTA*: Software Updates Over-the-Air.

*VIN*: Vehicle Identification Number.

# **3. Rationale for and Scope of Uptane Standards**
This Standards document clarifies the essential components and best practices 
for the secure design implentation and deployment of Uptane by OEMs and suppiers.
These practices contribute to compromise resilience, or the ability
to minimize the extent of the threat posed by any given attack.

## **3.1. Why Uptane requires standards**
A standards document that can guide the safe design, integration and deployment of
Uptane in cars is needed at this time because:

* The number of connected units on the average vehicle continues to grow, with 
mainstream cars now containing up to [10 million lines](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2016/06/28/your-average-car-lot-more-code-driven-than-you-think/86437052/)
of code.

* The [expanded use of software over-the-air](https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/automakers-embrace-over-the-air-updates-can-we-trust-digital-car-repair/)
strategies creates new attack surfaces for malicious parties.

* Legacy update strategies, such as SSL/TLS or GPG/RSA, are not feasible for use
on automotive ECUs because they force manufacturers to chose between enhanced
security and customizability.

* Conventional strategies are also complicated by the differing resources of the 
ECUs, which can vary greatly in memory, storage space, and Internet connectivity.

* The design of Uptane makes it possible to offer improved design flexibility, without
sacrificing security. 

* This added design flexibility, however, could be a liability if the framework is
implemented incorrectly.

* Standardization of crucial steps in the design, implementation and use of
Uptane can assure that customizability does not impact security or functionality.

## **3.2. Scope of Standards Coverage**
TODO

### **3.2.1. Use Cases**
TODO
## **3.2.2. Exceptions**
To DO

## **3.2.3. Out of Scope**
The following topics will not be addressed in this document, as they
represent threats outside the scope of Uptane:

* Physical attacks, such as manual tampering with ECUs outside the
vehicle.

* Compromise of the supply chain (e.g., build system, version control system, 
packaging process). A number of strategies already (e.g., git signing, TPMs, in-toto)
exist to address this problem. Therefore, there is no need duplicate those
techniques here. 

* Problems associated with OBD or UDS programming of ECUs, such as
authentication of communications between ECUs.

## **3.2.4 Design Requirements**

The design requirements for this document are goverened by three principal
parameters: 

* to clearly mandate the design and implementation steps that are 
security critical and must be followed as is, while offering flexibility
in the implementation of non-critical steps. In this manner, users 
can adapt to support different use models and deployment scenarios. 

* to delineate best practices to ensure that, should a vehicle 
be attacked, an attacker is forced to compromise many different
systems.

* to ensure that, if implemented, the security practices mandated or 
suggested in this document do not interfere with the functionality
of ECUs, vehicles, or the
manufacturing systems on which they run.

# **4. Threat Model and Attack Strategies**

The connnected units on automobiles are vulnerable to a number of 
threats, which can be organized by attacker goals into four categories.
These categories are presented below in order of increasing severity
of the threat. Proper implementation of Uptane is designed to 
prevent or minimize the impact of these strategies.

## **4.1. Read updates to steal intellectual property**

This is generally achieved with an *Eavesdrop attack*, where attackers are 
able to intercept and read unencrypted updates sent from the repository
to the vehicles.

## **4.2. Deny updates to prevent vehicles from fixing software problems**
Attackers seeking to limit or prevent access to updates may employ a 
number of strategies, including the following.

  * *Drop-request attack:* blocks network traffic outside or inside the 
  vehicle.
  * *Slow retrieval attack:* slows down delivery of updates to ECUs so a 
  known security vulnerability can be exploited before a corrective patch
  is received.
  * *Freeze attack:* continues to send the last known update to an ECU, 
  even if a newer update exists.
  * *Partial bundle installation attack:* drips traffic to selected 
  Allows only part of an update
  to install by dropping traffic to selected ECUs.
  
## **4.3. Interfere with ECU functionality:** 
Attackers seeking to change the actual
functionality of vehicle ECUs may do so in one of the following ways:

  * *Rollback attack:* tricks an ECU into installing outdated software with
  known vulnerabilities.
  * Endless data attack: causes an ECU to crash by sending it an infinite amount
  of data until it runs out of storage.
  * *Mixed-bundles attack:* shuts down an ECU by causing it to install incompatible
  versions of software updates that must not be installed at the same time. 
  Attackers can accomplish this by showing different bundles to different 
  ECUs at the same time.
  * *Mix-and-match attack:* If attackers have compromised repository keys, 
  they can use these keys to release arbitrary combinations of new versions of images.
  
## **4.4. Control the ECU:**
The last and most severe threat is if an attack seeks to remotely control the ECU.
The attacker can modify the vehicle’s performance through an arbitrary software
attack, in which the software on an ECU is overwritten with a malicious software program.

# **5. Detailed Design of Uptane**

At a high level, Uptane requires:

* Two software repositories:
    * An image repository containing binary images for install, and signed metadata about those images
    * A director repository connected to an inventory database that can sign metadata on demand for images
    in the image repository
* Repository tools for generating Uptane-specific metadata about images
* A public key infrastructure supporting the required metadata production/signing 
roles on each repository:
    * Root - Certificate authority for the repo. Distributes public keys for verifying
    all the other roles' metadata
    * Timestamp - Indicates whether there are new metadata or images
    * Snapshot - Indicates images released by the repository at a point in time, 
    via signing metadata about targets metadata
    * Targets - Indicates metadata about images, such as hashes and file sizes
* A time server to deliver cryptographically verifiable time to ECUs
* An in-vehicle client on a primary ECU capable of verifying the signatures on all 
update metadata, handling all server communication, and downloading updates on
behalf of secondary ECUs
* A client or library on each secondary ECU capable of performing either
full or partial verification of metadata

## **5.1. Roles on repositories {#roles}**

A repository contains images and metadata. Each role has a particular type of 
metadata associated with it, as described in {{meta_syntax}}.

### **5.1.1. The Root role {#root_role}**

The Root role SHALL be responsible for a Certificate Authority as defined in {{RFC3647}}.
The Root role SHALL produce and sign Root metadata as described in {{root_meta}}.
The Root role SHALL sign the public keys used to verfy the metadata produced by the
Timestamp, Snapshot, and Targets roles.
The Root role SHALL revoke keys for the other roles, in case of compromise.

### **5.1.2. The Targets role {#targets_role}**

The Targets role SHALL produce and sign metadata about images and delegations as described in {{targets_meta}}.

#### **5.1.2.1. Delegations**

The Targets role on the Image repository MAY delegate the responsibility of signing metadata
to other, custom-defined roles. If it does, it MUST do so as specified in {{delegations_meta}}.

Responsibility for signing images or a subset of images MAY be delegated to more than one
role, and therefore it is possible for two different roles to be trusted for signing a
particular image. For this reason, delegations MUST be prioritized.

A particular delegation for a subset of images MAY be designated as **terminating**.
For terminating delegations, the client SHALL NOT search the any further if it does
not find validly signed metadata about those images in the terminating delegation. 
Delegations SHOULD NOT be terminating by default; terminating delegations SHOULD 
only be used when there is a compelling technical reason to do so.

A delegation for a subset of images MAY be a multi-role delegation. A multi-role
delegation indicates that each of the delegatee roles MUST sign the same metadata.

Delegations only apply to the Image repository. The Targets role on the Director
repository MUST NOT delegate metadata signing responsibility.

### **5.1.3. The Snapshot role {#snapshot_role}**

The Snapshot role SHALL produce and sign metadata about all Targets metadata
the repository releases, including the current version number and hash of the main 
Targets metadata and the version numbers and hashes of all delegated targets
metadata, as described in {{snapshot_meta}}.

### **5.1.4. The Timestamp role {#timestamp_role}**

The Timestamp role SHALL produce and sign metadata indicating whether there are 
new metadata or images on the repository. It MUST do so by signing the metadata
about the Snapshot metadata file.

## **5.2. Metadata abstract syntax {#meta_syntax}**

### **5.2.1. Common Metadata Structures and Formats**

### **5.2.2. Root Metadata {#root_meta}**

### **5.2.3. Targets Metadata {#targets_meta}**

#### **5.2.3.1 Metadata about Images**

#### **5.2.3.2 Metadata about Delegations {#delegations_meta}**

### **5.2.4. Snapshot Metadata {#snapshot_meta}**

### **5.2.5 Timestamp Metadata {#timestamp_meta}**

## **5.3 Server / repository implementation requirements**

An Uptane implementation SHALL make the following services available to vehicles:

* Image repository
* Director repository
* Time server

### **5.3.1 Image Repository**

The Image repository exists to allow an OEM and/or its suppliers to upload images and
their associated metadata. It makes these images and their metadata available to 
vehicles. The Image repository is designed to be primarily controlled by human actors,
and updated relatively infrequently.

The Image repository SHALL expose an interface permitting the download of metadata
and images. This interface SHOULD be public.

The Image repository SHALL require authorization for writing metadata and images.

The Image repository SHALL provide a method for authorized users to upload images
and their associated metadata. It SHALL check that a user writing metadata and images
is authorized to do so for that specific image by checking the chain of delegations
for the image as described in {{delegations_meta}}.

The Image repository SHALL implement storage which permits authorized users to
write an image file using a unique filename, and later read the same file using
the same name. It MAY use any filesystem, key-value store, or database that
fulfills this requirement.

The Image repository MAY require authentication for read access.

### **5.3.2. Director Repository**

The Director repository instructs ECUs as to which images should be installed
by producing signed metadata on demand. Unlike the Image repository, it is
mostly controlled by automated, online processes. It also consults a private
inventory database containing information on vehicles, ECUs, and software
revisions.

The Directory repository SHALL expose an interface for primaries to upload
vehicle version manifests and download metadata. This interface SHOULD be public.

The Director MAY encrypt images for ECUs that require it, either by encrypting
on-the-fly or by storing encrypted images in the repository.

The Director repository SHALL implement storage which permits an automated
service to write generated metadata files. It MAY use any filesystem, 
key-value store, or database that fulfills this requirement.

#### **5.3.2.1. Directing installation of images on vehicles**

A Director repository MUST conform to the following six-step process for
directing the installation of software images on a 
vehicle.

1. When the Director receives a vehicle version manifest sent by a 
primary (as described in {{construct_manifest}}), 
it decodes the manifest, and determines the unique vehicle identifier.

2. Using the vehicle identifier, the Director queries its
inventory database (as described in {{inventory_db}})
for relevant information about each ECU in the vehicle.

3. The Director checks the manifest for accuracy compared to the
information in the inventory database. If any of the 
required checks fail, the Director drops the request. An implementor
MAY make whatever additional checks they wish. At a minimum,
the following checks are required:
    * Each ECU recorded in the inventory database is also represented in the manifest.
    * The signature of the manifest matches the ECU key of the primary that sent it.
    * The signature of each secondary's contribution to the manifest matches the ECU key of that secondary.
    
4. The Director extracts information about currently installed images from the vehicle
version manifest. Using this information, it determines if the vehicle is already
up-to-date, and if not, determines a set of images that should be installed. 
The exact process by which this determination takes place is out of scope of this standard.
However, it MUST take into account *dependencies* and *conflicts* between images, and SHOULD 
onsult well-established techniques for dependency resolution.

5. The Director MAY encrypt images for ECUs that require it./

6. The Director generates new metadata representing the desired set of images to be 
installed on the vehicle, based on the dependency resolution in step 4. This 
includes targets ({{targets_meta}}), snapshot ({{snapshot_meta}}), and 
timestamp ({{timestamp_meta}}) metadata. It then sends this metadata 
to the primary as described in {{download_meta}}.

#### **5.3.2.2. Inventory Database {#inventory_db}**

The Director SHALL use a private inventory database to store information
about ECUs and vehicles. An implementor MAY use any durable database
for this purpose.

The inventory database MUST record the following pieces of information:

* Per vehicle:
    * A unique identifier (such as a VIN)
* Per ECU:
    * A unique identifier (such as a serial number)
    * The vehicle identifier with which the ECU is associated
    * A public key
    * The format of the public key
    * Whether the ECU is a primary or a secondary

The inventory database MAY record other information about ECUs and vehicles.

### **5.3.3. Time Server**

The Time Server exists to inform vehicles about the current time in
cryptographically secure way, since many ECUs in a vehicle will not
have a reliable source of time. It receives lists of tokens from 
vehicles, and returns back a signed sequence that includes the token
and the current time.

The Time Server SHALL receive a sequence of tokens from a vehicle 
representing all of its ECUs. In response, it SHALL sign each token
together with the current time.

The Time Server SHALL expose a public interface allowing primaries to
communicate with it. This communication MAY occur over FTP, 
FTPS, SFTP, HTTP, or HTTPS.
